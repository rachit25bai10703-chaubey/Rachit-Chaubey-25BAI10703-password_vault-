This program is basically a home-built password manager called CypherVault.
Think of it like a small offline “vault” that stores all your website passwords, encrypts them, and only unlocks when you type in your master password.This is a locally stored, heavily encrypted, command-line password manager that automatically handles salts, hashing, encryption, clipboard clearing, and password organization.
