CypherVault (Humanised & Concise)

1. Introduction

CypherVault is a secure, terminal-based password manager designed to help users safely store, retrieve, and manage their passwords.
The goal is simple: keep your passwords safe while giving you easy access and full control through a lightweight Python application.

CypherVault protects your data using strong encryption, automatic clipboard handling, and multiple layers of hashing. It is built with privacy and security as the top priorities.

2. Key Features

🔐 1. AES-256 Encrypted Password Vault

Uses AES in CBC mode for strong encryption.

Every time the vault is updated or accessed, a new cryptographic salt is generated to increase security.


📋 2. Clipboard Auto-Clear

When a password is retrieved, it is copied to the clipboard.

Clipboard automatically clears itself after 10 seconds, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.


🔑 3. Master Password Protection

A master password controls access to the vault.

The master password is stretched to hundreds of MB using PBKDF2 and additional hashing rounds to resist brute-force attacks.


🧂 4. Cryptographically Secure Salt

A fresh, randomly generated 100-digit salt is used frequently:

login

password changes

returning to main menu

exiting the program


Salt is generated using secure OS randomness.


🧪 5. Password Audit System

Whenever a password is created, the program audits its strength.

Checks for:

length

uppercase

lowercase

digits

symbols


Encourages users to choose strong, safe passwords.


🔧 6. Additional Utilities

Generate secure random passwords.

Print list of saved sites and usernames.

Import passwords in JSON format.

Inspect the vault in plain text (with warnings).

Prevent edits to code by applying read-only permissions.

3. How CypherVault Works

Step 1 — Launch

When the program starts, it checks if the vault exists.
If not, it creates a new one using a default password.

Step 2 — Master Login

User enters the master password.
If correct, the encrypted vault is decrypted and loaded.

Step 3 — Main Menu

The user can:

1. Add or edit passwords


2. Delete passwords


3. View site/user list


4. Generate random passwords


5. Import/export JSON passwords


6. Retrieve passwords (clipboard auto-clear)



Step 4 — Encryption

Whenever the vault changes, it is:

converted to JSON

encrypted using AES-256 CBC

stored back in cyphervault.txt

4. Security Measures (Simple Explanation)

Although the code looks complex, the idea is straightforward:
make your password vault extremely hard to crack.

The program uses:

AES-256 encryption (bank-grade security)

PBKDF2 key stretching (slows down attackers)

SHA-512, SHA-3, Blake2b hashing cycles (multiple layers of protection)

Cryptographically secure random number generation

Memory-intensive hashing to block GPU attacks


It also uses xclip to handle clipboard safely.

5. Conclusion

CypherVault is a powerful yet simple password manager built with Python.
It combines:

strong encryption

password strength auditing

clipboard safety

JSON-based storage

secure hashing
to offer a reliable tool for password management.


The project showcases:

secure coding practices
